    <h1>Azizi Adeyemo</h1>
    <p>After 4 years of teaching and one of travel I am looking for a new career where I can better use
        my problem-solving skills and affinity technical understand. Throughout my degree I found the
        experience of solving problems with code and computation to be one of the most rewarding
        aspects of study. I would now like to return to that passion and develop my understanding and
        ability further, working for a company that will grow and enhance my potential. I am always
        excited to tackle new problems and I am flexible to the changing situations of a busy work
        environment.</p>
